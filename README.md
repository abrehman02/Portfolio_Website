Hello, Iâ€™m Abdul Rehman! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a final-year Mathematics and Computing undergraduate at Delhi Technical University, deeply passionate about machine learning, data science, and software development. Here, youâ€™ll find projects and resources that reflect my journey and expertise in fields like NLP, Computer Vision, and more.

Iâ€™m proficient in Python, C++, and JavaScript and skilled in tools, libraries, and frameworks such as React, Streamlit, and Firebase as a database manager. My project portfolio showcases some of my favorite work, including:

WhatsApp Chat Analysis Tool â€“ An interactive analysis tool built with Streamlit and Pandas.
Filmflix â€“ A personalized movie recommendation app powered by FlutterFlow and Firebase.
Portfolio Website â€“ A self-built interactive site where you can ask questions about my resume content.
With a curious mindset and a commitment to continuous learning, Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and finding innovative ways to solve problems. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect if you'd like to discuss tech, projects, or potential collaborations!
